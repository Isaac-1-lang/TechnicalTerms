Step 2: Core Concepts You Must Understand
Firebase

Firestore: NoSQL database → data stored in collections and documents.

Firebase Auth: Handles sign-up/sign-in with providers like Google, email, etc.

Firebase Storage: Upload and retrieve files.

Firebase Hosting: Deploy your frontend (React, Vue, etc.).

Firebase Cloud Functions: Write serverless backend logic.

Best for:

Realtime chat apps, social apps, dashboards, IoT, etc.

When you want to skip SQL and focus on scalability & speed.



Supabase

PostgreSQL Database: Fully relational (supports SQL, constraints, joins).

Auth: Based on Postgres roles + JWT tokens.

Storage: Store files, images, and documents.

Edge Functions: Write custom backend logic (like Firebase Cloud Functions).

Realtime API: Built using Postgres replication for realtime features.

Dashboard: You can manage database visually.

Best for:

Developers who love SQL, want more backend control.

When you need custom APIs or migrations.

Perfect for TypeScript and Next.js integration.
