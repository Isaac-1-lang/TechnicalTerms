📦 Databases & Data Storage

PostgreSQL → A powerful open-source relational database (tables, rows, SQL queries). Great for structured data.

MongoDB → A NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents, good for flexible and unstructured data.

Redis → An in-memory key–value store, often used for caching, real-time analytics, queues, and session management.

MySQL → Another relational database (similar to PostgreSQL), widely used for web apps.

SQLite → A lightweight SQL database often used for local apps and embedded systems.

📡 Messaging, Notifications & Communication

Twilio → Cloud API service for sending SMS, WhatsApp messages, voice calls, and video calls.

Socket.io → A library for enabling real-time communication between client and server (chat apps, live notifications).

WebSockets → Protocol underlying Socket.io, enabling persistent 2-way communication.

☁️ Cloud & Serverless

Serverless Connection → Running backend functions on demand (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) without managing servers.

Supabase → A backend-as-a-service built on PostgreSQL (provides APIs, auth, and storage).

Firebase → Google’s serverless platform for real-time DB, auth, hosting, and storage.

⚙️ Backend Frameworks & Tools

Node.js → JavaScript runtime for building backend servers.

Express.js → A lightweight Node.js framework for handling HTTP requests and APIs.

Spring Boot → Java framework for backend APIs and enterprise apps.

Laravel → PHP framework for backend apps.

Django → Python framework with batteries included (auth, ORM, admin, etc.).

🖥️ Frontend Frameworks & Tools

React.js → JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Next.js → React framework with SSR (server-side rendering) and routing.

Vite → Fast build tool for frontend projects.

Redux → State management tool for React apps.

Bootstrap → CSS framework for styling web pages.

Tailwind CSS → Utility-first CSS framework for custom designs.

🔒 Security & Cybersecurity

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) → Used for secure authentication between client & server.

OAuth2 → Standard protocol for authentication/authorization.

Kali Linux → A Linux distro specialized for penetration testing & cybersecurity.

Binary Exploitation → Hacking low-level code (memory, buffers, assembly).

Cryptography → Study of encryption, decryption, secure communication.

🧠 AI, ML & Data Science

TensorFlow → Open-source framework for deep learning and ML.

Pandas → Python library for working with data tables.

Scikit-learn → ML library for regression, classification, clustering.

OpenAI APIs → Provide AI models for chat, code, embeddings, etc.

Combinatorics / Matrices / Trigonometry → Math foundations you’ve been studying for ML and problem solving.

⚡ DevOps & System Tools

Docker → Containerization tool to package apps and dependencies.

Kubernetes → Orchestrates and manages many Docker containers.

Git & GitHub → Version control & collaboration platform.

CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) → Automating testing and deployment.
